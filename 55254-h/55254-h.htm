<h3><i>About This book</i></h3>
<p>Early on the morning of April 12, 1861, a mortar
shell fired from Fort Johnson in Charleston Harbor
burst almost directly over Fort Sumter, inaugurating
the tragic American Civil War. Two years later, Fort
Sumter, now in Confederate hands, became the focus
of a gallant defense in which determined Confederate
soldiers kept Federal land and naval forces at
bay for 587 days. The &ldquo;first shot&rdquo; of 1861 and the
Confederate defense of 1863-65 are the subjects of
the following pages. The narrative is based on an
earlier work by Frank Barnes, onetime historian at
Fort Sumter National Monument.</p>
<p>National Park handbooks, compact introductions
to the natural and historical places administered by
the National Park Service, are designed to promote
public understanding and enjoyment of the parks.
Each handbook is intended to be informative reading
and a useful guide to park features. More than
100 titles are in print. They are sold at parks and
can be purchased by mail from the Superintendent
of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office,
Washington, DC 20402.</p>

<p><b>&ldquo;... the character of the times particularly inculcates
the lesson that, whether to prevent or repel danger,
we ought not to be unprepared for it. This consideration

provision for the immediate extension and gradual

<span class="lr">&mdash;President James Madison to Congress,</span>
<span class="lr">December 15, 1815.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anyone visiting Fort Sumter today will find it difficult
to believe that it could ever have ranked among
the &ldquo;most spectacular harbor defense structures to
come out of any era of military architecture.&rdquo;
Wrecked by the Civil War, its walls reduced to half
their original height, the present fort only slightly
resembles the huge fortification that dominated the
entrance to Charleston Harbor in the middle years
of the 19th century.</p>
<p>Fort Sumter was one of a series of coastal fortifications
built by the United States after the War of
1812&mdash;a war that had shown the gross inadequacy of
American coastal defenses. The fort belonged to
what has come to be known as the Third American
System of coastal defense, embodying &ldquo;structural
durability, a high concentration of armament, and
enormous overall firepower.&rdquo; This system emerged
after Congress set up a military Board of Engineers
for Seacoast Fortifications in answer to President
Madison&rsquo;s plea.</p>
<p>Under the unofficial direction of Brig. Gen. Simon
Bernard, onetime military engineer to the emperor
Napoleon I, the Board began surveying the entire
coastline of the United States in 1817. The South Atlantic
coast, &ldquo;especially regarded as less important,&rdquo;
was not surveyed until 1821. One fortification report,
covering the Gulf coast and the Atlantic coast
between Cape Hatteras and the St. Croix River, had
been submitted to Congress earlier that year, but it
was not until the revised form of the report appeared
in 1826 that much thought was given to permanently
occupying the shoal in Charleston Harbor opposite
Fort Moultrie. If the location were feasible, the
Board reported, &ldquo;the fortification of the harbor may
be considered as an easy and simple problem.&rdquo; With
the guns of the projected fort crossing fire with those
of Fort Moultrie, the city of Charleston would be
most effectively protected against attack.</p>

<h4 class="interlude">Fort Sumter on the Eve of War</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>When Federal troops occupied
Fort Sumter in late December
1860, they found the
place &ldquo;filled with building
materials, guns, carriages,
shot, shell, derricks, timbers,
blocks and tackle, and coils
of rope in great confusion.&rdquo;
The soldiers spent many
weeks clearing away debris,
moving and mounting guns,
distributing shot, and bricking
up embrasures against a
threatened Confederate
attack. By April 1861 the fort
looked much as it does below.</p>
<p>The principal parts of the
1861 fort are identified in the
following list. Each is keyed
by number to the illustration.

<p>Plans for Fort Sumter were drawn up in 1827 and
adopted on December 5, 1828. In the course of that
winter Lt. Henry Brewerton, Corps of Engineers, assumed
charge of the project and commenced active
operations. But progress was slow, and as late as 1834
the new fort was no more than a hollow pentagonal
rock &ldquo;mole&rdquo; two feet above low water and open at
one side to permit supply ships to pass to the interior.
Meanwhile, the fort had been named Sumter in honor
of Thomas Sumter, brigadier general commanding
South Carolina militia during the Revolution.</p>
<p>Operations were suspended late in the autumn of
1834 when ownership of the site came into question.
The previous May, one William Laval, a resident of
Charleston, had secured from the State a rather
vague grant to 870 acres of &ldquo;land&rdquo; in Charleston
Harbor. In November, acting under this grant, Laval
notified the representative of the U.S. Engineers at
Fort Johnson of his claim to the site of Fort Sumter.
In the meantime, the South Carolina Legislature had
become curious about the operations in Charleston
Harbor and began to question &ldquo;whether the creation
of an Island on a shoal in the Channel, may not
injuriously affect the navigation and commerce of
the Harbor.&rdquo; The following month, the Committee
on Federal Relations reported that it could not
&ldquo;ascertain by what authority the Government had
assumed to erect the works alluded to.&rdquo; Acting
apparently under the impression that a formal deed
of cession to &ldquo;land&rdquo; ordinarily covered with water
had not been necessary, the Federal Government had
commenced operations at the mouth of Charleston
Harbor without seeking or receiving State approval
to do so.</p>
<p>Laval&rsquo;s claim was invalidated by the State&rsquo;s attorney
general in 1837, but the harbor issue remained
unresolved. It was November 1841 before the Federal
Government received clear title to the 125 acres
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
of harbor &ldquo;land,&rdquo; although construction of Fort Sumter
had resumed the previous January under the skillful
guidance of Capt. A. H. Bowman, who pushed
the work forward.</p>
<p>Bowman changed the original plans in several
respects, the most important involving the composition
of the foundation. Instead of a &ldquo;grillage of
continuous square timbers&rdquo; upon the rock mass, he
proposed laying several courses of granite blocks
because he feared worms would completely destroy
the wood; and palmetto, which might have resisted
such attacks, did not have the compactness of fiber
or the necessary strength to support the weight of
the superstructure.</p>
<p>Work was difficult. The granite foundation had to
be laid between periods of high and low tide, and
there were times when the water level permitted no
work to be done at all. The excessive heat of the
Charleston summers was a recurrent problem; so
was yellow fever. Much of the building material had
to be brought in from the North. The magnitude of
the task is indicated by the quantities involved:
about 10,000 tons of granite (some of it from as far
away as the Penobscot River region of Maine) and
well over 60,000 tons of other rock. Bricks, shells,
and sand could be obtained locally, but even here
there were problems. Local brickyard capacities
were small and millions of bricks were required.
Similarly, hundreds of thousands of bushels of shells
were needed&mdash;for concrete, for the foundation of
the first-tier casemate floors, and for use in the
parade fill next to the enrockment. Even the actual
delivery of supplies, however local in origin, was a
problem, for then, as now, the fort was a difficult
spot at which to land.</p>
<p>By 1860 Fort Sumter outwardly possessed a commanding
and formidable appearance. Its five-foot-thick
pentagonal-shaped brick masonry walls towered
nearly 50 feet above low water and enclosed a
parade ground of roughly one acre. Along four of
the walls extended two tiers of arched gunrooms.
Officers&rsquo; quarters lined the fifth side&mdash;the 316.7-foot
gorge. (This wall was to be armed only along the
parapet.) Three-story brick barracks for the enlisted
garrison paralleled the gunrooms on each flank. The
sally port at the center of the gorge opened on a 171-foot
wharf and a 25&frac12;-foot-wide stone esplanade that
extended the length of that wall.</p>

at West Point had been artillery

Anderson, whose refusal to
surrender Fort Sumter to his
former pupil led to the opening
shots of the Civil War.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>Outward appearances, however, were deceiving.
Unruffled decades of peace had induced glacial
slowness and indifference in Washington. The fort
was far from completed and, according to U.S. Army
Surgeon Samuel W. Crawford who came to know
the place well, &ldquo;in no condition for defense.&rdquo; Eight-foot-square
openings yawned in place of gun embrasures
on the second tier. Of the 135 guns planned for
the gunrooms and the open terre-plein above, only 15
had been mounted. Most of these were 32 pounders;
none was heavier. The barracks were unfinished
and, where tenable, occupied by workmen. The
officers&rsquo; quarters were also unfinished, and a large
number of wooden structures &ldquo;of the most temporary
character&rdquo; occupied the parade. These &ldquo;served
as storehouses for the tools and material of the
workmen, while all over the parade lay sand and
rough masonry, and sixty-six guns with their carriages
and 5,600 shot and shell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By December 1860 time as well as money had run
out, and the fort was about to take on a political
significance far beyond the military function it was
originally intended to serve. The long-smoldering sectional
dispute between North and South had become
like a powder keg. And Fort Sumter was the fuse
that would ignite it.</p>

<h3 id="c3">Fort Sumter and the Coming of War, 1861</h3>
<p>The headline in the Charleston <i>Mercury</i> summed it
up aptly. After decades of sectional conflict, South
Carolinians responded to the election of the first
Republican President, Abraham Lincoln, by voting
unanimously in convention on December 20, 1860,
to secede from the Union. Within six weeks five other
States&mdash;Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, and
Louisiana&mdash;followed her example. Early in February
1861 they met in Montgomery, Alabama, adopted a
constitution, set up a provisional government&mdash;the
Confederate States of America&mdash;and elected Jefferson
Davis of Mississippi as President. By March 2,
when Texas joined the Confederacy, nearly all the
forts and naval yards in the seceded States had been
seized by the new power. Fort Sumter was one of the
handful that remained in Federal possession.</p>
<p>When South Carolina left the Union, the only post
in Charleston Harbor garrisoned in strength by United
States troops was Fort Moultrie on Sullivans Island.
There, Maj. Robert Anderson commanded two companies
of the First U.S. Artillery&mdash;about 85 officers
and men. But six days after the secession ordinance
was passed, Anderson, believing Moultrie to be indefensible,
transferred his command to Fort Sumter.
Unaware of an apparent pledge to maintain the harbor
<i>status quo</i>, given by President James Buchanan
some weeks before, Anderson acted in accordance
with verbal instructions he received December 11 to
<i>hold possession of the forts in this harbor, and if
attacked ... to defend yourself to the last extremity.
The smallness of your force will not permit you,
perhaps, to occupy more than one of the three forts,
but an attack on or attempt to take possession of any
of them will be regarded as an act of hostility, and
you may then put your command into either of them
which you may deem most proper to increase its
power of resistance. You are also authorized to take
similar steps whenever you have tangible evidence
of a design to proceed to a hostile act.</i></p>

sympathizer, condemned
Anderson&rsquo;s occupation of

</div>
<p>Anderson thought he had &ldquo;tangible evidence&rdquo; of
hostile intent, both towards Fort Moultrie&mdash;an old
fort vulnerable to land attack&mdash;and toward Fort
Sumter, then occupied by about 80 engineer workmen.
He moved, Anderson afterwards wrote to
Secretary of War John B. Floyd, &ldquo;to prevent the
effusion of blood&rdquo; and because he was certain &ldquo;that
if attacked my men must have been sacrificed, and
the command of the harbor lost.&rdquo; To Anderson, a
Kentuckian married to a Georgian, preservation of
peace was of paramount importance. At the same
time, as a veteran soldier of unquestioned loyalty, he
had a duty to perform.</p>
<p>Charlestonians were outraged. Crowds collected
in the streets; military organizations paraded; and
&ldquo;loud and violent were the expressions of feeling
against Major Anderson and his action.&rdquo; On December
27 South Carolina volunteers occupied Fort
Moultrie and Castle Pinckney, a third harbor fort,
and began erecting defensive batteries elsewhere
around the harbor. South Carolina&rsquo;s governor, Francis
Pickens, regarded Anderson&rsquo;s move not only as
an &ldquo;outrageous breach of faith&rdquo; but an act of aggression,
and demanded, through commissioners
sent to Washington, that the Federal Government
evacuate Charleston Harbor. On December 28 President
Buchanan, while admitting that the occupation
of Sumter was against his policy, refused to accede
to the demand.</p>
<p>The North was exultant. On New Year&rsquo;s Day,
1861, amid cheers for Major Anderson, salvos of
artillery resounded in northern cities. By an imposing
majority, the House of Representatives voted
approval of Anderson&rsquo;s &ldquo;bold and patriotic&rdquo; act. The
only question that remained was whether the national
government would continue to support him.</p>
<p>At Fort Sumter, Anderson&rsquo;s 85 officers and men
(plus the engineer workmen who remained after the
fort was occupied) garrisoned a fortification intended
for as many as 650 and had &ldquo;about 4 months&rdquo;
supply of provisions. In January President Buchanan
was persuaded to send off a relief expedition. Initial
plans called for sending the sloop of war <i>Brooklyn</i>
for this purpose, but when word arrived that the
South Carolinians had obstructed the harbor entrance
by sinking several ships, it was decided to use
the <i>Star of the West</i>, an ordinary merchant ship,
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
which would excite less suspicion and avoid the
appearance of coercive intent. Two hundred men,
small arms and ammunition, and several months&rsquo;
provisions were placed aboard. The men were to
remain below deck on entering Charleston Harbor;
the <i>Brooklyn</i> would follow, in case the <i>Star of the
West</i> were fired upon and disabled.</p>
<p>But Charleston had been forewarned, and when
the <i>Star of the West</i> appeared at the entrance of the
harbor on January 9, 1861, cadets from the Citadel
military college opened fire with several cannons
mounted on Morris Island. The unarmed ship turned
back. Anderson had held his fire, thinking the firing
unauthorized. Orders authorizing supporting fire on
his part had failed to reach him in time. For the
moment, civil war had been avoided.</p>
<p>Further relief plans were now shelved, since President
Buchanan was anxious to end his term of office
in peace. Yet it was apparent that eventually
the garrison would have to be supplied or the fort
abandoned.</p>
<p>On January 10, Acting Secretary of War Joseph
Holt (Floyd, a Southern sympathizer, had resigned
over Buchanan&rsquo;s refusal to evacuate Fort Sumter)
ordered Anderson to act strictly on the defensive.
Anderson and Governor Pickens had already exchanged
angry letters over the firing on the <i>Star of
the West</i>, and when the major refused the governor&rsquo;s
demand to surrender the fort (January 11),
Pickens sent Isaac W. Haynes, the State&rsquo;s attorney
general, to Washington to try once again to get
the Federal troops removed. If this failed, Haynes
was to offer to buy the fort from the government.
President Buchanan refused to do either. The stalemate
continued.</p>

the President, &ldquo;I can travel

Anderson stayed and

</div>
<p>Fort Sumter was now preparing for attack. Thirty-eight
more guns were mounted in the first tier of
casemates and along the parapet, including heavier
42-pounders and Columbiads. Five Columbiads were
mounted in the parade as mortars and three howitzers
about the sally port (gateway) in the gorge. By
April 12, a total of 60 guns were ready. &ldquo;Bombproof&rdquo;
shelters and &ldquo;splinter-proof&rdquo; traverses were constructed
on the parade ground and along the parapet.
Overhanging galleries were built out from the
parapet at strategic points for dropping shells on an
assaulting force. Special protection was given the
sally port. The second tier of casemates was left
unarmed, however, and the 8-foot-square openings
in the outer wall were bricked up. The small size of
Anderson&rsquo;s garrison did not permit manning them.</p>

<p>Charleston, too, prepared. Besides continuing
routine maintenance at Castle Pinckney and Fort
Moultrie, additional batteries were set up on Sullivans
Island, at Cummings Point on Morris Island,
and outside Fort Johnson. An &ldquo;ironclad&rdquo; Columbiad
battery, constructed of inclined logs plated with
iron, was also mounted at Cummings Point. Meanwhile,
Governor Pickens continued to allow Anderson
to buy fresh meat and vegetables in town to
supplement his garrison &ldquo;issue&rdquo; supply.</p>
<p>On March 1, the Confederate States government
assumed control of military operations in and around
Charleston Harbor and sent Brig. Gen. Pierre Gustave
Toutant Beauregard to take command. Like
Anderson, Beauregard (who arrived at Charleston
on March 3) was a veteran of the Mexican War. He
was a member of a Louisiana family of distinguished
French lineage. Late captain in the U. S. Army, he
had served briefly as superintendent of the U. S. Military
Academy at West Point as recently as January.
Once, years back, he had studied artillery there under
Major Anderson. Now, pupil confronted master.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>President Abraham Lincoln
wanted his inaugural address
to convey a conciliatory
message to the South. Most
Southerners, however, like
Emma Holmes of Charleston,
thought it &ldquo;stupid, ambiguous,
vulgar and insolent&rdquo; and
&ldquo;a virtual declaration of
war.&rdquo; When Lincoln decided
to send supplies to Anderson,
Confederate efforts to force
the evacuation of Sumter
took on new urgency.</i></p>
</div>
<p>When Abraham Lincoln assumed office as President
of the United States on March 4, he made it
clear in a firm but generally conciliatory inaugural
address that national authority must be upheld
against the threat of disunion. As to the Federal forts
and property in the seceded States, he said: &ldquo;The
power confided to me will be used to hold, occupy,
and possess the property and places belonging to the
Government....&rdquo; (He did not say &ldquo;repossess.&rdquo;) Furthermore,
there need be &ldquo;no bloodshed or violence&rdquo;
as the result of this policy &ldquo;unless it be forced upon
the national authority.&rdquo; The President concluded:</p>
<p><i>In your hands, my dissatisfied fellow-countrymen,
and not in mine, is the momentous issue of civil war.
The Government will not assail you. You can have
no conflict without being yourselves the aggressors.
You have no oath registered in Heaven to destroy
the Government, while I shall have the most solemn
one to &lsquo;preserve, protect, and defend&rsquo; it.</i></p>
<p>The Sumter situation was placed squarely before
Lincoln on the day he assumed office. On the morning
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
of Inaugural Day outgoing Secretary of War Holt
received a dispatch from Major Anderson indicating
that the remainder of the &ldquo;issue&rdquo; rations brought
over from Fort Moultrie in December would last
only a few more weeks. He might be able to hold out
longer if he was able to maintain his local fresh food
supply, but if that were cut off, the garrison would be
in desperate straits. As to reenforcements, given the
state of local Confederate preparations, an estimated
force of 20,000 men would now be needed to return
Federal authority to Charleston Harbor. Given these
circumstances, reenforcement was out of the question.
The entire Army of the United States numbered
less than 16,000 men. &ldquo;Evacuation seems almost
inevitable,&rdquo; wrote General in Chief Winfield Scott;
the majority of Lincoln&rsquo;s Cabinet agreed. The President,
however, was not yet willing to concede that
point and sent Capt. Gustavus W. Fox, onetime U.S.
Navy officer and long an advocate of a relief expedition,
to Charleston to talk directly with Anderson.
In the meantime, reassured by Secretary of State
William Seward and others, the South came to
believe that Fort Sumter would be evacuated.</p>

Cameron, informed Major Anderson that an attempt
would be made to supply him with provisions &ldquo;and,
in case the effort is resisted ... to reenforce you.&rdquo;
Convinced from Captain Fox&rsquo;s on-the-spot reports
that such an expedition was feasible, and that there
was no Union sentiment in South Carolina to which
to appeal, Lincoln had decided on the nearest thing
to preserving the <i>status quo</i>. Merchant steamers
under cover of ships of war would carry &ldquo;subsistence
and other supplies&rdquo; to Anderson; the warships (with
troop reinforcements on board) would be used only
if a peaceable landing were opposed. Fox would
command. Meanwhile, in accordance with a pledge
already given, the governor of South Carolina would
be carefully informed in advance.</p>
<p>The announcement of the expedition to supply
Fort Sumter was the spark that set off the explosive
forces which had been building up since 1850. The
Confederate capital at Montgomery was informed.
Anderson&rsquo;s supply of fresh provisions had already
been cut off on the 7th; now, his mail was seized.</p>
<p>Work was pushed on the harbor fortifications. A
new battery mounting two 24-pounders and two 32-pounders
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
was unmasked on Sullivans Island; another
ironclad battery was put into position at its western
tip. Originally designed to be &ldquo;floating,&rdquo; this battery
mounted two heavy 42-pounders in addition to two
32-pounders. Near Mount Pleasant another (10-inch)
mortar battery was installed. At Fort Moultrie, 11
guns now bore on Fort Sumter, including three 8-inch
Columbiads. Additional guns were mounted to
command the harbor channels and to guard against
landings by the Federal fleet. Three thousand more
Confederate troops were called, bringing the number
already on the post to 3,700. The harbor seethed
with activity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gage is thrown down,&rdquo; said the Charleston
<i>Mercury</i>, &ldquo;and we accept the challenge. We will
meet the invader, and God and Battle must decide
the issue between the hirelings of Abolition hate and
Northern tyranny, and the people of South Carolina
defending their freedom and their homes.&rdquo; A small
12-pounder Blakely rifled cannon arrived from England&mdash;a
gift of a Charlestonian residing in London.
Mounted at Cummings Point, it proved an ominous
forerunner of the powerful rifled guns that two years
later would reduce Fort Sumter to rubble.</p>
<p>After cabinet debate in Montgomery, the Confederate
Secretary of War, Leroy Pope Walker, ordered
General Beauregard to demand the evacuation of the
fort, and if that demand was refused, to &ldquo;reduce it.&rdquo; On
the afternoon of April 11, three of Beauregard&rsquo;s aides
visited the fort under a flag of truce and presented the
ultimatum. Major Anderson refused compliance but
at the same time said, &ldquo;Gentlemen, if you do not batter
the fort to pieces about us, we shall be starved out
in a few days.&rdquo; Still reluctant to initiate conflict, the
Montgomery government telegraphed Beauregard:</p>
<p><i>Do not desire needlessly to bombard Fort Sumter. If
Major Anderson will state the time at which ... he
will evacuate, and agree that in the meantime he will
not use his guns against us unless ours should be
employed against Fort Sumter, you are authorized
thus to avoid the effusion of blood. If this or its
equivalent be refused, reduce the fort</i>....</p>
<p>The atmosphere in Charleston was tense. In at
least one household, dinner was the &ldquo;merriest, maddest
... yet. Men were more audaciously wise and
witty. We had an unspoken foreboding it was to be
our last pleasant meeting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shortly after midnight, four Confederate officers
confronted Anderson again. About three hours later,
in a carefully worded reply, the Union commander
agreed to evacuate &ldquo;by noon on the 15th&rdquo; unless he
should receive prior to that time &ldquo;controlling instructions
from my Government or additional supplies.&rdquo;
But it was expected in Charleston that the Federal
supply ships would arrive before the 15th. Anderson&rsquo;s
reply was rejected by the Confederate officers, who
proceeded at once to Fort Johnson to give the order
to open fire.</p>
<p>At 4:30 a.m., a mortar shell from Fort Johnson
arched across the sky and burst almost directly over
Fort Sumter. This was the signal for opening the
bombardment. Within a few minutes, a ring of cannons
and mortars about the harbor&mdash;43 in all&mdash;were
firing at Sumter. Major Anderson withheld fire until
about 7 o&rsquo;clock. Then Capt. Abner Doubleday,
Anderson&rsquo;s second in command, fired a shot at the
ironclad battery on Cummings Point. Ominously,
the light shot &ldquo;bounded off from the sloping roof ...
without producing any apparent effect.&rdquo; Not at any
time during the battle did the guns of Fort Sumter do
great damage to the Confederate defenses. Most of
Fort Sumter&rsquo;s heaviest guns were on the parapet and
in the parade. To reduce casualties in the small garrison,
Anderson ordered these left unmanned. For a
while, with the help of the engineer workmen remaining
at the fort, nine or ten of the casemate guns were
manned. But by noon, the expenditure of ammunition
was so rapid that the firing was restricted to six
guns only. Meanwhile, an eyewitness later recorded,</p>
<p><i>Showers of balls from 10-inch Columbiads and 42
pounders, and shells from [10-] inch mortars poured
into the fort in one incessant stream, causing great
flakes of masonry to fall in all directions. When the
immense mortar shells, after sailing high in the air,
came down in a vertical direction, and buried themselves
in the parade ground, their explosion shook
the fort like an earthquake</i>.</p>
<p>All Charleston watched. Business was entirely
suspended. King Street was deserted. The Battery,
the wharves and shipping, and &ldquo;every steeple and
cupola in the city&rdquo; were crowded with anxious spectators.
And &ldquo;never before had such crowds of ladies
without attendants&rdquo; visited the streets of Charleston.
&ldquo;The women were wild&rdquo; on the housetops. In the
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
darkness before dawn there were &ldquo;Prayers from the
women and imprecations from the men; and then a
shell would light up the scene.&rdquo; As the day advanced,
the city became rife with rumors: &ldquo;Tonight, they say,
the forces are to attempt to land. The <i>Harriet Lane</i>
had her wheel house smashed and put back to sea....
We hear nothing, can listen to nothing. Boom boom
goes the cannon all the time. The nervous strain is
awful....&rdquo; Volunteers rushed to join their companies.
There was &ldquo;Stark Means marching under the
piazza at the head of his regiment ...,&rdquo; his proud
mother leaning over the balcony rail &ldquo;looking with
tearful eyes.&rdquo; Two members of the Palmetto Guard
paid $50 for a boat to carry them to Morris Island.</p>
<p>The barracks at Fort Sumter caught fire three
times that first day, but each time the fire was extinguished.
One gun on the parapet was dismounted;
another was damaged. The wall about one embrasure
was shattered to a depth of 20 inches. That was
caused, in part, by the Blakely rifle, firing with &ldquo;the
accuracy of a duelling pistol.&rdquo; The quarters on the
gorge were completely riddled. When night came,
dark and stormy, Fort Sumter&rsquo;s fire ceased entirely.
Using the six needles available, the work of making
cartridge bags continued; blankets, old clothing,
extra hospital sheets, and even paper, were used in
the emergency. Meantime, the supply fleet, off the
bar since the onset of hostilities, did no more than
maintain its position. It had been crippled upon departure
when Seward&rsquo;s meddling caused withdrawal
of the powerful warship <i>Powhatan</i>. Now, bad weather
prevented even a minimum supporting operation.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 13th, Sumter opened &ldquo;early
and spitefully,&rdquo; and, with the increased supply of
cartridges, kept up a brisk fire for a while. About
mid-morning &ldquo;hotshot&rdquo; (solid cannonballs heated
red hot) set fire to the officers&rsquo; quarters. The Confederate
fire then increased; soon the whole extent of
the quarters was in flames, endangering the powder
magazines. The blaze spread to the barracks. By noon
the fort was almost uninhabitable. The men crowded
to the embrasures for air or lay on the ground with
handkerchiefs over their mouths. Valiant efforts by
Anderson&rsquo;s men had saved some of the powder before
the onrush of the flames forced the closing of
the magazines, and the fort&rsquo;s defenders continued to
fire. At every shot, Beauregard later reported, the
Confederate troops, &ldquo;carried away by their natural
generous impulses, mounted the different batteries,
and ... cheered the garrison for its pluck and
gallantry and hooted the fleet lying inactive just
outside the bar.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>About 1:30 in the afternoon the flag was shot
down. Almost accidentally, this led to surrender. By
authority of Gen. James Simons, commanding on
Morris Island, Col. Louis T. Wigfall, a former Texas
senator and now one of Beauregard&rsquo;s aides detached
for duty at that spot, set out by small boat to
ascertain whether Anderson would capitulate. Before
he arrived at the beleaguered fort, the United
States flag was again flying, but Wigfall rowed on.
The firing continued from the batteries across the
harbor. Attaching a white handkerchief to the point
of his sword, Wigfall entered the fort through an
embrasure on the left flank and offered the Federal
commander any terms he desired, the precise nature
of which would have to be arranged with General
Beauregard. Anderson accepted on the basis of
Beauregard&rsquo;s original terms: evacuation with his
command, taking arms and all private and company
property, saluting the United States flag as it was
lowered, and being conveyed, if desired, to a Northern
port. The white flag went up again; the firing
ceased. Wigfall departed confident that Anderson
had surrendered unconditionally. He and his boatman
were borne ashore in triumph.</p>

</div>
<p>Meanwhile, officers had arrived at the fort from
General Beauregard&rsquo;s headquarters in Charleston.
From these men, dispatched to offer assistance to
the Federal commander, Anderson learned that
Wigfall&rsquo;s action was unauthorized; that, indeed, the
colonel had not seen the commanding general since
the start of the battle. From another party of officers
he learned Beauregard&rsquo;s exact terms of surrender.
They failed to include the privilege of saluting the
flag, though in all other respects they were the same
as those Anderson had believed he had accepted
from Wigfall. Impetuously, Anderson had first declared
he would run up his flag again. Then, restrained
by Beauregard&rsquo;s aides, he waited while his
request for permission to salute the flag was conveyed
to the commanding general. In the course of
the afternoon, Beauregard courteously sent over a
fire engine from the city. About 7:30 that evening,
Beauregard&rsquo;s chief of staff returned with word that
Anderson&rsquo;s request would be granted and the terms
offered on the 11th would be faithfully adhered to.
The engagement was officially at an end. During the
34-hour bombardment, more than 3,000 shells had
been hurled at the fort.</p>

<p>When Maj. Robert Anderson

garrison from Fort Moultrie
to Fort Sumter on the night of
December 26, 1860, he took
with him not only needed
supplies and equipment but
the two flags of his command&mdash;the
20-by-36-foot
garrison flag, which he carried
himself, and the smaller
storm flag used during bad
weather. At noon on December
27, following a prayer of
thanksgiving for their safe
arrival (shown in the painting), the garrison
flag was raised above Sumter.</p>

<p>The garrison flag (the remnants
of which are shown in
photograph no. 1) continued
to mark Anderson&rsquo;s
occupation of the fort until
April 11, 1861, when, having
become torn, it was replaced
by the 10-foot by 20-foot
storm flag (no. 2) which flew
during the subsequent two-day
bombardment.</p>
<p>After the fort&rsquo;s surrender
on April 14, Anderson took
both flags with him to New
York City. There, following
their display in a massive
patriotic demonstration in
Union Square, they were
boxed up and placed in storage.
The flags remained with
the Anderson family until
1905, when they were presented
to then Secretary of
War William Howard Taft.
The War Department transferred
them to the National
Park Service in 1954. They
are now part of the collections
of Fort Sumter National
Monument. A third flag in the
park&rsquo;s collection is the 6-foot
by 9-foot flag of the Palmetto
Guards (no. 3), which was
the first Southern banner to
be raised over Sumter&rsquo;s walls
after Anderson&rsquo;s evacuation.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>On Sunday, April 14, Anderson and his garrison
marched out of the fort with drums beating and
colors flying and boarded the steamer <i>Isabel</i> to join
the Federal fleet off the bar. The only fatality of the
engagement occurred just prior to leaving when, on
the 47th round of what was to have been a 100-gun
salute to the United States flag, one of the guns
discharged prematurely, exploding a pile of cartridges
and causing the death of Pvt. Daniel Hough.
Another man, Pvt. Edward Galloway, was mortally
wounded and died several days later. The 50th round
was the last. Now, as the <i>Isabel</i> carrying Anderson&rsquo;s
command steamed down the channel, the soldiers at
the Confederate battery on Cummings Point lined
the beach, heads uncovered, in silent tribute to
Sumter&rsquo;s defenders.</p>
<p>The following day, April 15, 1861, President Lincoln
issued a call for 75,000 militia. Soon the States
of Virginia, Arkansas, Tennessee, and North Carolina
joined the Confederacy. Civil war, so long
dreaded, had begun.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<h3 id="c4">The Struggle for Charleston, 1863-65</h3>
<p>With Fort Sumter in Confederate hands, the port of
Charleston became an irritating loophole in the
Federal naval blockade of the Atlantic coast&mdash;doubly
so because at Charleston &ldquo;rebellion first lighted the
flame of civil war.&rdquo; As late as January 1863, vessels
plied to and from Charleston and the Bahamas &ldquo;with
the certainty and promptness of a regular line,&rdquo;
bringing needed war supplies in exchange for cotton.</p>
<p>Capture of Port Royal Harbor on November 7,
1861, by a Federal fleet under Capt. Samuel F. Du
Pont, however, had made possible land and sea operations
against Charleston. In June 1862, an attempt
was made by Federal Maj. Gen. David Hunter to
push through to the city by James Island on the
south. This ended in Union disaster at the bloody
battle of Secessionville. Meanwhile, the <i>Monitor-Virginia</i>
(<i>Merrimack</i>) action in Hampton Roads had
demonstrated the feasibility of an &ldquo;ironclad&rdquo; naval
expedition against Fort Sumter, the key to the
harbor. Sumter, rebuilt and strengthened, was now a
formidable work armed with some 95 guns and garrisoned
with upwards of 500 men. By May 1862, the
Navy Department seemed possessed of what then
Rear Admiral Du Pont was calling a &ldquo;morbid appetite&rdquo;
to capture Charleston. But the War Department,
far from supplying the additional troops to Hunter&rsquo;s
command, withdrew units to reenforce Gen. George
B. McClellan&rsquo;s army in its campaign against Richmond,
the Confederate capital.</p>
<p>On April 5, 1863, a fleet of nine Federal ironclads,
armed with 32 heavy-caliber guns, appeared off
Charleston bar. Seven were of the single-turret
&ldquo;cheesebox on a raft&rdquo; <i>Monitor</i>-type; one, the
<i>Keokuk</i>, was a double-turreted affair; and the last,
the flagship <i>New Ironsides</i>, was an ironclad frigate.
With ebb tide on the afternoon of the 7th, the
&ldquo;new-fangled&rdquo; ironclads steamed single-file up the
main ship channel east of Morris Island. The weather
was clear and bright; the water &ldquo;as stable as of a
river.&rdquo; By 3 o&rsquo;clock, the <i>Weehawken</i>, the leading
monitor, had come within range, and Fort Moultrie
opened fire. The <i>Passaic</i>, second in line, responded.
Fort Sumter held fire, its guns trained on a buoy at
the turn of the channel. When the <i>Weehawken</i> came
abreast of that point, Sumter&rsquo;s right flank guns let
loose. These were followed by all the guns on
Sullivans Island, at Fort Moultrie, and at Cummings
Point that could be brought to bear.</p>

<p>It was too much for the slow and unwieldy
ironclads. In the course of the 2&frac12;-hour fight, only
one came within 900 yards of Fort Sumter. To the
2,209 rounds hurled against them, the ironclads were
able to return 154, only 34 of which found the target.
These breached and loosened 25 feet of the right
flank parapet and pocked the walls elsewhere with
craters up to 2&frac12; feet deep. But it was far from
enough; Fort Sumter remained strong and secure.
On the other hand, five of the ironclads were
seriously disabled by the accurate Confederate fire,
and one, the <i>Keokuk</i>, sank the following morning in
the shallow water off Morris Island. Confederate
troops later recovered the guns of the <i>Keokuk</i> and
mounted one of them at Fort Sumter.</p>
<p>The North, confident of victory, was stunned by
Du Pont&rsquo;s failure at a time when the general military
situation was gloomy. The war in the East had been
bloody and indecisive; the news from the West was
no better. Federal authorities now looked to a
combined operation to seize Morris Island and from
there demolish Fort Sumter. With Fort Sumter
reduced, the harbor could be entered.</p>
<p>Folly Island and Coles Island, next south of Morris
Island, had been occupied by Northern troops just
prior to the naval attack. In June and July, the north
end of Folly Island was fortified. In a remarkable operation,
47 guns and mortars were secretly emplaced
&ldquo;within speaking distance of the enemy&rsquo;s pickets.&rdquo;
Some 11,000 men were concentrated on the island.
Brig. Gen. Quincy A. Gillmore, the &ldquo;breacher&rdquo; of
Fort Pulaski, took command on June 12. Rear Adm.
John A. Dahlgren superseded Admiral Du Pont on
July 6.</p>
<p>During that time the Confederates mounted guns
at the south end of Morris Island and strengthened
the earthworks at its upper end&mdash;Battery Gregg at
Cummings Point and Battery Wagner some 1,400
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
yards to the south. The latter work, commanding the

<p>Fort Sumter, 1,390 yards distant from Battery
Gregg, prepared for siege, too. Brick and stone
masonry &ldquo;counter-forts,&rdquo; already built at each extremity
of the esplanade as protection for the
magazines, were now strengthened, and much of the
remaining gorge exterior was sandbagged or otherwise
protected. The casemates on the right or sea
front flank were filled with sand, and the rooms on
the gorge were filled with damp cotton bales laid in
sand. The upper-tier magazines were abandoned and
filled with sandbags to protect the magazines below.
Protective revetments and other defensive devices
were introduced at various points throughout the
fort. Frequently during this period the garrison was
host to officers on leave, citizens of Charleston, and
even many ladies, who came to see the scars of the
April battle, to admire the drill, or to observe the
preparations. At the end of June 1863, Fort Sumter
was garrisoned by five companies (perhaps 500 men)
of the First South Carolina Artillery, under command
of Col. Alfred Rhett. Its armament had been
reduced to 68 guns and mortars, many of the best
pieces having been removed to strengthen other
fortifications about the harbor.</p>
<p>On the morning of July 10, 3,000 Union infantry,
supported by four monitors and the artillery on Folly
Island, descended on the southern end of Morris
Island. Directing the attack was Brig. Gen. Truman
Seymour, a company commander at Fort Sumter
two years before. Within four hours, most of the
Island was in his hands. The Confederate forces,
outgunned and outmanned, fell back to Battery
Wagner. Sumter&rsquo;s guns helped to cover their retreat.</p>
<p>A &ldquo;desperate&rdquo; assault upon Wagner the next morning
failed, though the parapet was briefly gained.
General Gillmore established counter-batteries and
tried again on the 18th. From noon until nightfall
that day, &ldquo;without cessation or intermission,&rdquo; Federal
guns poured a &ldquo;storm of shot and shell upon
Fort Wagner ... perhaps unequalled in history.&rdquo;
This was followed by an attack by some 6,000
troops, spearheaded by the 54th Massachusetts, the
first U.S. black regiment to go to war. In a short,
savage struggle, Seymour&rsquo;s force suffered 1,500 casualties.
Though one angle of the fort was gained and
held for a time, the attack was repulsed.</p>

</div>
<p>Thwarted in his plan to secure easy possession of
Morris Island as a base for breaching operations
against Fort Sumter, Gillmore now determined to
batter the fort into submission from the ground he
already possessed. Batteries Wagner and Gregg
would be taken by protracted siege operations.
Anticipating that Sumter was &ldquo;liable to be silenced
sooner or later&rdquo; and fearing attack at other points
about the harbor, Confederate authorities continued
to remove the fort&rsquo;s guns and ammunition for use
elsewhere. By mid-August, Sumter&rsquo;s armament was
reduced to 38 cannon and two mortars.</p>
<p>At distances of 2 to 2&frac12; miles from Fort Sumter&mdash;distances
extraordinary for such operations&mdash;Gillmore
set up eight batteries of heavy rifled cannon.
In the marsh west of Morris Island, where the mud
was like liquid, his engineers successfully placed a
200-pounder Parrott rifle&mdash;the notorious &ldquo;Swamp
Angel&rdquo;&mdash;to fire on Charleston.</p>
<p>Gillmore&rsquo;s batteries did some experimental firing
in late July and early August, testing the range and
the effects of their shots on Sumter. The real bombardment
began on August 17, with nearly 1,000
shells being fired that first day alone. Almost 5,000
more were fired during the week that followed. Even
at the end of the first day it was obvious that the fort
was never intended to withstand the heavy Parrotts.
Three days later, a monstrous 13-ton Parrott rifle
hurling 250-pound shells was added to Gillmore&rsquo;s
armament, making 18 rifled cannon in action. The
range kept Sumter from replying to the land batteries,
and the monitors appeared only fleetingly.</p>
<p>On the 21st, with the &ldquo;Swamp Angel&rdquo; in position,
Gillmore demanded the evacuation of Fort Sumter
and Morris Island. Otherwise he would fire on
Charleston. The ultimatum was unsigned, however,
and before the Confederates could confirm its origin,
Gillmore had opened fire. But little damage had been
done when, on the 36th round, the &ldquo;Swamp Angel&rdquo;
burst. Meanwhile, Beauregard had delivered an indignant
reply. The bombardment of Sumter continued.</p>
<p>Early on the 23d, against Dahlgren&rsquo;s ironclads,
Fort Sumter fired what proved to be its last shots in
action. Its brick masonry walls were shattered and
undermined; a breach 8 by 10 feet yawned in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
upper casemates of the left face; at points, the sloped
debris of the walls already provided a practicable
route for assault. Still, the Confederate garrison,
supplemented by a force of 200 to 400 blacks,
labored night and day, strengthening and repairing
the defenses. The debris, accumulating above the
sand- and cotton-filled rooms, itself bolstered the
crumbling walls. By the 24th, Gillmore was able to
report the &ldquo;practical demolition&rdquo; of the fort. On the
26th General Beauregard ordered the fort held &ldquo;to
the last extremity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bombardment continued sporadically during
the following week. On the night of September 1-2,
the ironclads moved against the fort&mdash;the first major
naval operation against Fort Sumter since the preceding
April. For five hours, the frigate <i>New Ironsides</i>
and five monitors bombarded the fort, now
without a gun with which to answer the &ldquo;sneaking
sea-devils.&rdquo; Two hundred and forty-five shot and
shell were hurled against the ruins&mdash;twice as many
as were thrown in the April attack. The tidal
conditions, plus a &ldquo;rapid and sustained&rdquo; fire from
Fort Moultrie, forced the monitors to withdraw.</p>
<p>Some desultory firing on the 2d brought to an end
the first sustained bombardment of Fort Sumter.
More than 7,300 rounds had been hurled against the
fort since August 17. Now, with the fort reduced to a
&ldquo;shapeless and harmless mass of ruins,&rdquo; the Federals
could concentrate on Battery Wagner, only 100 yards
from Gillmore&rsquo;s forward trenches.</p>
<p>On the morning of September 5, Federal cannoneers
began a devastating barrage against Battery
Wagner. For 42 hours, night and day, in what
General Gillmore called a spectacle &ldquo;of surpassing
sublimity and grandeur,&rdquo; 17 mortars and nine rifled
cannon, as well as the powerful guns of the ironclads,
pounded the earthwork. Calcium lights turned night
into day. On the night of September 6-7, the Confederates
evacuated Wagner and Gregg. Morris Island
was at last in Union hands.</p>
<p>Fort Sumter, however, remained defiant. When
Dahlgren demanded the fort&rsquo;s surrender, on the
morning of the 7th, General Beauregard sent word
that the admiral could have it when he could &ldquo;take it
and hold it.&rdquo; On September 4 the garrison had been
relieved by fresh troops, 320 strong. Maj. Stephen
Elliott succeeded to the command.</p>

<div class="img">

</div>
<blockquote>
<p>On July 10, 1863, Union
forces successfully invaded
Morris Island, a narrow
stretch of land which formed
the southern entrance to
Charleston Harbor. The Confederate
defenders were
pushed back nearly 3 miles
to a strong fortification known
as Battery Wagner, whose
heavy guns commanded
nearly the entire length of
the island. Gen. Quincy A.
Gillmore knew that this fort
would have to be taken if
Morris Island was to serve as
a base of operations against
Charleston.</p>
<p>Accordingly, at dusk on
July 18th, three Union brigades
numbering about 6,000
men commanded by Gen.
Truman Seymour assembled
for an assault on Battery
Wagner. Assigned to lead the
column was Col. Robert
Gould Shaw&rsquo;s 54th Massachusetts
Infantry, composed of
600 free-black men recruited
from various Northern States.
&ldquo;We shall take the fort or die
there!&rdquo; shouted Colonel Shaw as Seymour ordered
the troops forward.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>Col. Robert Gould Shaw</i></p>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>Wagner&rsquo;s artillery opened
fire when the Federals were
within 200 yards of the battery.
Then the fort&rsquo;s defenders,
North and South Carolina
troops, let fly a volley of
musketry that tore huge gaps
in the Union ranks. Those
who survived this terrible fire,
having reached the ditch in
front of the fort, sloshed
through 3 feet of water and
scrambled up the walls of the
parapet bravely waving both
the national flag and the
Massachusetts State colors.
Shaw himself gained the rampart
and shouted, &ldquo;Forward,
Fifty-fourth!&rdquo;, then fell dead
with a bullet in his heart.</p>
<p>Now other Federal regiments
joined in the attack,
but after several hours of desperate
fighting, including
hand-to-hand combat on
Wagner&rsquo;s parapet, the Federals
were driven back. Bodies
lay piled three deep in front
of the fort and 9 of the 10
Union regimental commanders
were killed or wounded.
The 54th Massachusetts alone
lost nearly 40 percent of the
men engaged.</p>
<p>Battery Wagner finally
came into Union hands on
September 6, 1863, after the
Confederates were ordered
to evacuate Morris Island
entirely. Contrary to Northern
expectations, Fort Sumter
and the city of Charleston
did not fall into Federal possession
until February 1865.</p>

</div>
<p>Dahlgren &ldquo;immediately designed to put into operation
a plan to capture Fort Sumter.&rdquo; Accordingly the
monitor <i>Weehawken</i> was ordered &ldquo;to cut off all
communication&rdquo; via Cummings Point, while <i>New
Ironsides</i> and the remaining ironclads moved up
&ldquo;to feel, and if possible, pass&rdquo; the obstructions
thought to be in the channel north of the fort. But
<i>Weehawken</i> grounded, and the monitors caught
such a severe fire from Fort Moultrie and the other
Confederate batteries on Sullivans Island, that the
admiral &ldquo;deemed it best to give [his] entire attention
to the <i>Weehawken</i>&rdquo; and withdraw. Whatever his
original plan, Dahlgren now decided upon a small-boat
assault. The task seemed simple: with &ldquo;nothing
but a corporal&rsquo;s guard in the fort,&rdquo; all he had to do
was &ldquo;go and take possession.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the night of September 8-9, 400 sailors and
marines made the attempt. A tug towed the small
boats within 800 yards of the fort, then cast them
loose. In the darkness and confusion, plans went
awry and two columns advanced simultaneously
upon the right flank of the fort. The Confederates
coolly held their fire till the Federals in the lead
boats began to land, then let loose with musketry,
hand grenades, &ldquo;fire balls,&rdquo; grape and canister,
brickbats, and masonry fragments. At a signal from
the fort, the Confederate gunboat <i>Chicora</i> steamed
out from the harbor and opened fire; Fort Moultrie
&ldquo;fired like a devil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the outer boats, the marines replied rapidly
for a few minutes. Some of the sailors ashore fired a
few shots from their revolvers, but most sought
refuge in the embrasures or breaches in the wall. It
was all over in 20 minutes. Most of the boats did not
even touch shore. The Federal loss was 124 killed,
wounded, and captured, and five boats were taken.
A similar expedition from Gillmore&rsquo;s command was
detained by low tide in a creek west of Morris Island.
Service rivalry had prevented active cooperation
that might have resulted in victory.</p>
<p>Except for a six-day bombardment of &ldquo;minor&rdquo;
proportions late in September, Fort Sumter was free
of attack for almost two months. Damages sustained
by the monitors in the Morris Island operation, as
much as Fort Moultrie&rsquo;s increased firepower and the
fear of channel obstructions (a menace which later
proved to be greatly exaggerated), made Admiral
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
Dahlgren reluctant to make another move at this
time. General Gillmore, engaged now in rebuilding
and rearming the captured Confederate batteries on
Cummings Point, thought he had accomplished his
part of the operation. In his opinion, Fort Sumter was
effectively reduced; its actual seizure and occupation
would be costly and unnecessary; besides, the reinforcements
needed for such an undertaking were not
available anyway. Indeed, with the Confederate surrender
of Vicksburg and the defeat of Gen. Robert E.
Lee&rsquo;s army at Gettysburg, Charleston had suddenly
become much less important. Gillmore contemplated
no further offensive operations by his forces.</p>
<p>On October 26, having learned that the Confederates
were remounting some of Sumter&rsquo;s guns, Gillmore
resumed the bombardment. For the next 12
days, the concentration of fire was comparable to
the great bombardment of the preceding August.
But now, with the new batteries on Cummings Point
in operation and the range shortened to less than a
mile, the effect was far greater. For the first time, 16
heavy mortars were in use&mdash;two of them 8&frac12;-ton
pieces (13-inch bore) throwing 200-pound projectiles.
Their sharp, plunging fire was added to that of 12
Parrott rifles&mdash;the types already used so effectively
against the fort&mdash;and one powerful Columbiad. In
addition, two monitors, with guns &ldquo;equal to a dozen&rdquo;
Parrotts, crossed fire with Gillmore&rsquo;s artillery.</p>
<p>Sumter&rsquo;s sea front (right flank), upright and relatively
unscathed till now, was breached for nearly
half its length. The ramparts and arches of its upper
casemates were cut down and the interior barracks
demolished. The accumulated debris made ascent
easy inside and out. Through the breach, the Federal
guns took the channel fronts in reverse. Exposed to
direct fire for the first time, they were soon cut and
jagged. Still, the gorge ruin remained much the
same; to Admiral Dahlgren, that &ldquo;heap of rubbish&rdquo;
looked invincible.</p>
<p>Night and day throughout November and into
December, Gillmore&rsquo;s batteries, assisted occasionally
by the monitors, maintained a slow fire against
the fort. Sumter could respond with merely &ldquo;harmless
musketry,&rdquo; but its defenders seemed &ldquo;snug in the
ruins.&rdquo; And if Sumter was without cannons, Confederate
batteries on James and Sullivans Islands kept
up an irritating counterfire.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>By August 23, 1863, when the
photograph was taken, General Gillmore&rsquo;s
siege guns had been
firing at Fort Sumter continuously
for a week in what
came to be known as the
&ldquo;First Great Bombardment.&rdquo;
By then, according to Gen. J.
W. Turner, Gillmore&rsquo;s chief
of artillery, &ldquo;The demolition
of the fort ... was complete
so far as its offensive powers
were considered. Every gun
upon the parapet was either
dismounted or seriously damaged.
The parapet could be
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
seen in many places both on
the sea and channel faces to
be completely torn away
from the <i>terre-plein</i>. The
place, in fine, was a ruin, and
effectually disabled for any
immediate defense of the
harbor of Charleston.&rdquo;</p>
<p>General Turner&rsquo;s assessment
of Fort Sumter&rsquo;s &ldquo;demolition&rdquo;
proved premature.
Thanks to the efforts of its
garrison over the next several
months, the fort was transformed,
according to chief
engineer Maj. John Johnson,
from &ldquo;a shapeless pile of
shattered walls and casemates,
showing here and there
the guns disabled and half
buried in splintered wrecks
of carriages, its mounds of
rubbish fairly reeking with
the smoke and smell of powder,
... into a powerful earthwork,
impregnable to assault,
and even supporting the other
works at the entrance of
Charleston harbor with six
guns of the heaviest caliber.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>Maj. John A. Johnson, commanding

Sumter during the 1863-65
Confederate occupation.</i></p>
</div>
<p>On November 6, the Confederate engineer at Fort
Sumter, Maj. John Johnson, reported that while the
height of the mass of the fort was &ldquo;diminishing
visibly on the sides away from the city, when it gets
down to the lower casemates it will have become so
thick from accumulated debris as to resist further
battering.&rdquo; Two weeks later, he found the fort
stronger than ever, with casualties surprisingly low&mdash;only
two men were killed in the August bombardment
and only 22 more since the start of the present
one; 118 had been wounded. Johnson was not fearful
of being driven out by the big Federal guns, but
rather &ldquo;exposure to assault from barges at night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In mid-November such an attack seemed to be
forthcoming. During the early hours of the 18th, the
defenders of the fort had four distinct alarms as
small boats approached within hailing distance; &ldquo;all
hands out each time and expecting a fight.&rdquo; On the
following night, a force estimated at 250 men approached
within 300 yards of the fort, only to be
driven off by the muskets of the aroused garrison.
This was not, however, a real attack but only a
reconnaissance ordered by Gillmore &ldquo;with a view to
compel the garrison to show its strength.&rdquo; Having
done that, he would now wait for the Navy to make
the next move.</p>
<p>But Admiral Dahlgren could not move until the
repairs on the monitors were finished, and as late as
January 1864 these still were not completed. Even
so, confronted with reports of greatly strengthened
harbor fortifications and a growing concern over the
exact nature of the harbor obstructions, he was reluctant
to move without additional monitors. Defeat was
always possible, and defeat for the Union&rsquo;s only ironclad
squadron might have serious consequences&mdash;not
only for the blockade and Gillmore&rsquo;s command
on Morris Island, but for operations elsewhere along
the coast. Nevertheless, substantial advantages had
already been gained: the blockade at Charleston was
tighter with Morris Island in Federal hands. To all
this, the Navy Department agreed. Elsewhere, while
Dahlgren and Gillmore marked time, the war gathered
momentum. In November 1863, the North won
decisively at Chattanooga.</p>
<p>The additional monitors, always promised, never
seemed to arrive. On December 5, General Gillmore
stopped the bombardment of Fort Sumter begun 41
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
days earlier. There seemed no great advantage in
continuing, and it required considerable ammunition.
He had made his last sustained effort against
the fort. On only four other days in December did he
fire any rounds at all. During the four months he
remained in command, the firing was intermittent,
never more than &ldquo;minor&rdquo; in character. Meanwhile,
Gen. Ulysses S. Grant&rsquo;s forthcoming operations in
Virginia required all available troops. On May 1,
1864, Gillmore departed for Fort Monroe with 18,000
picked men and quantities of valuable mat&eacute;riel.</p>
<p>Dahlgren&rsquo;s much-needed monitors never did arrive
(Grant needed those, too) and, with the monitor
force he did have reduced to six by the foundering of
the <i>Weehawken</i> in December, further offensive operations
against Charleston seemed completely out of
the question. In June, the ironclad frigate <i>New
Ironsides</i> was withdrawn to the north.</p>
<p>In the preceding December, Fort Sumter had
been an almost chaotic ruin. But with the fort
practically left alone during the months immediately
following, the garrison gradually restored order from
chaos. The parade ground, excavated well below
high-water level to provide sand-filling, was cleared,
drained, and partially rebuilt. Trim ranks of gabions
(wicker baskets filled with sand) bolstered the sloping
debris of the walls on the interior. The three-gun
battery in the lower right face was lined with logs
and planks, 10 feet deep, and revetted more thoroughly
in the rear. In casemates on the left flank
another three-gun battery was created. Through the
disordered debris of the left and right faces, the
garrison tunneled a 275-foot timbered gallery connecting
the two batteries and fort headquarters in
the left flank. And in from the rubble of the sea
front, the garrison built a loopholed timber blockhouse
to cover the parade ground in the event of
further assault. In May, Capt. John C. Mitchel, son
of the Irish patriot, relieved Lt. Col. Stephen Elliott
in command.</p>
<p>The onset of summer, 1864, brought one more
attempt to take Fort Sumter; likewise another officer
of the original Fort Sumter garrison came into
the operation. Maj. Gen. John G. Foster, engineer of
the fort in April 1861, had succeeded to Gillmore&rsquo;s
command on May 26 and was convinced that &ldquo;with
proper arrangements&rdquo; the fort could easily be taken
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
&ldquo;at any time.&rdquo; The proper arrangements included
special light-draught steamers and 1,000-man &ldquo;assaulting
arks&rdquo; equipped with 51-foot scaling ladders
and elevated towers for sharpshooters. Though initial
War Department reaction was cool, Foster went
ahead with a preliminary operation to complete the
demolition of the fort. &ldquo;Yankee ingenuity&rdquo; might
succeed where routine operations had failed or been
judged too costly.</p>

</div>
<p>On July 7, 1864, Foster&rsquo;s batteries opened a sustained
bombardment against the ruin of Fort Sumter.
During the remainder of that month, an average of
350 rounds daily were hurled at the beleaguered fort.
In some respects, this was the heaviest bombardment
Fort Sumter had yet received. Although the
gorge ruin was wasted away at one point to within 20
feet of the water, and the shattered sea front was still
further reduced, the right face remained erect, its
three-gun battery intact; likewise most of the left
flank. To Admiral Dahlgren, as late as July 21, the
work seemed &ldquo;nearly impregnable.&rdquo; Debris added to
debris, feverish work day and night, and thousands
of bags of sand brought from the city by night
actually made the fort stronger than ever. If a
casemate were breached, it was speedily filled; if the
slopes of the ruin invited assault, a bristling array of
wooden pikes and barbed-wire entanglements were
provided; and there were always the muskets of the
300-man garrison.</p>
<p>The fire slackened in August; Foster&rsquo;s supply of
ammunition dwindled, and his requisitions for more
went unfulfilled. A scheme for &ldquo;shaking down&rdquo; the
fort walls by floating down large &ldquo;powder rafts&rdquo;
failed miserably. Mid-August brought final War Department
refusal to supply light-draft steamers; the
end of August, sharp disapproval of Foster&rsquo;s &ldquo;assaulting
arks.&rdquo; Meanwhile, Dahlgren had been unwilling
to cooperate in an alternate plan of assault and
Foster himself was ordered to remain strictly on the
defensive. He was also called upon to ship north
most of his remaining ammunition and four more
regiments of troops to be used in Grant&rsquo;s operations
against Richmond.</p>
<p>On September 4, the bombardment begun on
July 7 came to an end. In those 61 days, another
14,666 rounds had been hurled against the fort. Sixteen
of the garrison had been killed, 65 wounded. On
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>

Thomas A. Huguenin succeeded him that night.</p>

</div>
<p>The last great bombardment of Fort Sumter had
taken place. The firing was no more than desultory
after September 1864; less than a hundred rounds
were hurled at the fort in the months of December
and January; none at all in February. During the
autumn months it was all Foster&rsquo;s batteries could do
to make a reasonable defense of Morris Island, let
alone carry on any offensive operations.</p>
<p>In February 1865 the long stalemate came to an
end as Gen. William T. Sherman marched north
from Savannah through the interior of South Carolina,
slicing between the remnants of Gen. John B.
Hood&rsquo;s Confederate army on the west and the small
Confederate force remaining along the coast. On the
17th, with Sherman in Columbia, Fort Sumter and
the other Confederate fortifications in Charleston
harbor were quietly evacuated. At 9 o&rsquo;clock on the
morning of the 18th, the United States flag was once
more raised over Fort Sumter. The fortunes of war
had accomplished what 3,500 tons of metal, a fleet of
ironclads, and thousands of men had failed to do.</p>

which floated here during
peace, before the first act of
this cruel Rebellion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the flag rose to the top
of the staff and was caught by
the breeze from the ocean,
&ldquo;there was one tumultuous
shout.&rdquo; The guns of the harbor
then thundered in salute.
&ldquo;We raise our fathers&rsquo; banner,
that it may bring back better
blessings than those of old,&rdquo;
Henry Ward Beecher told the
crowd, &ldquo;that it may cast out
the devil of discord; that it
may restore lawful government
and a prosperity purer
and more enduring than that
which it protected before;
that it may win parted friends
from their alienation; that it
may inspire hope and inaugurate
universal liberty; ...
that it may heal all jealousies,
unite all policies, inspire a
new national life, compact
our strength, purify our principles,
ennoble our national
ambitions, and make this
people great and strong ...
for the peace of the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That night, there were
fireworks and a full-dress dinner
at the Charleston Hotel
hosted by General Gillmore.
Speeches and toasts followed
one another in quick succession.
One of the most moderate
and, as events proved,
ironic toasts, was given by
General Anderson. &ldquo;I beg
you, now,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;that
you will join me in drinking
the health of ... the man
who, when elected President
of the United States, was
compelled to reach the seat
of government without an
escort, but a man who now
could travel all over our
country with millions of
hands and hearts to sustain
him. I give you the good, the
great, the honest man, Abraham
Lincoln.&rdquo; Less than an
hour later, Abraham Lincoln
lay dying on the floor of a
Washington theater, an assassin&rsquo;s
bullet in his brain.</p>

<h3 id="c6">From Wartime Ruin to National Monument</h3>
<p>The task of clearing the rubble and
ruin of war from the interior of Fort
Sumter began in the 1870s. In the forefront
of the project was Quincy A.
Gillmore, whose Union gunners were
responsible for most of the destruction
in the first place. The outer walls
of the gorge and right flank, largely
demolished by the shellfire, were partially
rebuilt. The other walls of the
fort, left jagged and torn 30 to 40 feet
above the water, were leveled to approximately
half their original height.
Through a left flank casemate, where
a barracks once stood, a new sally port
was constructed. Within the fort itself,
earth and concrete supports for 10
rifled and smoothbore guns mounted
<i>en barbette</i> (guns placed on an open
parapet) began to take shape.</p>
<p>Construction was well advanced by
June 1876, when a shortage of funds
forced suspension of activity. By that
time, only three permanent barbette
platforms had been built; the other
seven remained temporary (wooden)
platforms upon which were mounted
four 8-inch Parrott rifles and two
15-inch Rodman smoothbores. In a
modification of the original plan, 11
lower-tier gunrooms of the original fort
along the right face and about the salient
had been repaired and armed with
6.4-inch Parrotts. These 17 guns, in a
gradually deteriorating state, constituted
Fort Sumter&rsquo;s armament for the
next 23 years.</p>
<p>From 1876 to 1898, the fort stood
largely neglected, important mainly as
a lighthouse station. Most of that time
it was also ungarrisoned and in the
charge of a &ldquo;fortkeeper&rdquo; or an ordnance
sergeant. Lacking maintenance
funds, Sumter, even then visited by
thousands each year, fell into a state
of dilapidation. By 1887 the wooden
barbette platforms had rotted away so
that &ldquo;not one gun could be safely
fired&rdquo;; the neat earth slopes had eroded
into &ldquo;irregular mounds&rdquo;; and quantities
of sand had drifted onto the parade
ground. At casemate level, salt
water dashed freely through the open
embrasures, the shutters of which were
no longer in working order, and the
guns rusted so badly that they could
not be moved on their tracks.</p>
<p>By the end of the century, the major
world powers were building massive
steel navies, and the United States
responded by modernizing its coastal
defenses. In 1899 two 12-inch breech-loading
rifled guns were installed at
Fort Sumter, their position further
strengthened by earth fill extending to
the top of the old walls. The massive
concrete emplacement for this battery
(named for South Carolinian Isaac
Huger, a major general in the American
Revolution) dominates the central
portion of the fort today. The guns,
long since outmoded, were removed
for scrap in 1943. During late World
War II, Fort Sumter was armed with
four 90-mm guns manned by a company
of Coast Artillery. The fort, transferred
from the War Department to
the National Park Service, became a
national monument on July 12, 1948.</p>
<p>The following guide highlights the
main historical portions of Fort Sumter
today. There is no set sequence by
which to see the fort, but you may want
to refer to the photograph on pages
<a class="pgref" href="#Page_56">56</a>-57 for orientation. Hours of operation
and tour boat schedules can be

<h3 id="c7">What to See at Fort Sumter</h3>
<h4 id="c8"><b>Sally Port</b></h4>
<p>This present-day entrance
to Fort Sumter, runs through the center
of the fort&rsquo;s left flank wall. It was
built after the Civil War and replaced
a gun embrasure. A marker on the
left flank near the sally port honors
Sumter&rsquo;s Confederate defenders. The
original sally port entered through the
gorge at the head of a 171-foot stone
wharf which once jutted out from the
center of the esplanade. The esplanade,
a 25&frac12;-foot-wide promenade and
landing space, extended the full length
of the gorge exterior at its base.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/i25.jpg" alt="Sally port" width="593" height="576" />
</div>
<h4 id="c9"><b>Left-Flank Casemates</b></h4>
<p>The first tier of
casemates (gunrooms) was surmounted
by a second tier identical in appearance.
At the time of the April 12, 1861,
bombardment these casemates contained
several 32-pounders, most of
which bore on Fort Johnson. Above
the second-tier casemates, guns were
mounted <i>en barbette</i> on an open terre-plein.
This arrangement was also used
on the fort&rsquo;s right flank and on its right
and left faces. Each casemate contained
one gun, which could be moved
on a track in order to adjust the angle
of fire through the embrasure. Fort
Sumter was designed for an armament
of 135 guns and a garrison of 650 men.
There are now two guns mounted on
the casemate carriages in the left flank.
The one on the left of the sally port is a
rifled and banded 42-pounder; the one
on the right is a 42-pounder smoothbore.
Shielded (by the mass of the
gorge) from Federal guns on Morris Island,
the left-flank casemates were used
as a Confederate headquarters and
hospital. The lower half of the outer
wall retained its full height until the
end of the siege, but was leveled to approximately
half this during the 1870s.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As is clear by comparing the
painting on pages <a class="pgref" href="#Page_8">8</a>-9 with
the photograph, Fort
Sumter today bears only a
superficial resemblance to its
original appearance. The
multi-tiered work of 1861
was reduced largely to rubble
during the Civil War, and
Battery Huger, built across
the parade ground at the
time of the Spanish-American
War, dominates the site.</p>

<h4 id="c10"><b>Left Face</b></h4>
<p>During the 1863-65 siege of
Charleston, reverse fire from Union
gunners on Morris Island crossed the
parade and struck the interior of the
left face, destroying the arched brick
casemates. Holes caused by these shots,
as well as several projectiles themselves,
are still visible in the wall. Outside
the casemate ruins are two 15-inch
smoothbore Rodman guns, an 8-inch
Columbiad, and a 10-inch mortar.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/i27.jpg" alt="Left face" width="500" height="487" />
</div>
<h4 id="c11"><b>Right Face</b></h4>
<p>Guns mounted on the
lower tier of this face dueled with Fort
Moultrie in the initial Confederate attack
of 1861. Since the angle of the
face allowed it to escape the destructive
fire from Federal batteries on
Morris Island, its outer wall still stood
almost at full height in February 1865.
After the destructive bombardments of
August 1863, the Confederate garrison
mounted three guns in the first-tier
casemates just above the right shoulder
angle. Referred to as the &ldquo;Palmetto
Battery,&rdquo; because of the protective log
cover raised on the exterior, this three-gun
position was the sole offensive armament
of the fort for several months.
All the lower-tier casemates were reclaimed
in the 1870s and armed with
100-pounder Parrott rifled cannon.
These guns, rusted and worn, were the
same type of cannon (and possibly the
identical pieces) used by the Federals
on Morris Island to bombard Fort
Sumter from 1863 to 1865. They were
buried with the casemates after Battery
Huger was constructed. When the
parade ground was excavated in 1959
these casemates were opened and 11
of these Parrott guns were uncovered.
They are now displayed in this face.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<h4 id="c12"><b>Right Gorge Angle</b></h4>
<p>From a gun in
the first-tier casemates, Capt. Abner
Doubleday fired the first shot from
Fort Sumter on April 12, 1861. This
section also sustained the deepest penetration
of Confederate shot and shell
in the initial attack.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/i27f.jpg" alt="Right gorge angle" width="488" height="481" />
</div>
<h4 id="c13"><b>Officers&rsquo; Quarters</b></h4>
<p>A three-story brick
building extended the entire length of
the gorge (or back wall). In it were
quarters for officers, administrative
offices, storerooms, powder magazines,
and guardhouse. Most of the wooden
portions of the building burned during
the initial Confederate bombardment
in 1861. The small-arms magazine here
exploded on December 11, 1863, killing
11 and wounding 41 Confederates.
The explosion also tilted the arch over
the magazine&rsquo;s entrance. (The effects
of that explosion are still visible today.)</p>

</div>
<h4 id="c14"><b>Enlisted Men&rsquo;s Barracks</b></h4>
<p>Paralleling the left flank casemates, are the ruins
of a three-story enlisted men&rsquo;s barracks
which originally rose slightly above the
fort walls. Another enlisted men&rsquo;s barracks,
identical to this one, was on the
right flank directly opposite this wall.</p>

</div>
<h4 id="c15"><b>Garrison Monument</b></h4>
<p>The U.S. Government
erected this monument in 1932
&ldquo;in memory of the garrison defending
Fort Sumter during the bombardment
of April 12-14, 1861.&rdquo; The tablet contains
a roster of the original garrison
that served under Major Anderson.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/i27j.jpg" alt="Garrison monument" width="486" height="229" />
</div>
<h4 id="c16"><b>Mountain Howitzer</b></h4>
<p>Confederates used several light field pieces, like this
12-pounder mountain howitzer, to defend
against a surprise assault by Union
infantry troops during the 1863-65
siege.</p>

<h3 id="c17">Other Points of Interest</h3>
<h4 id="c18"><b>Fort Moultrie</b></h4>
<p>Three different Fort Moultries have occupied this site. The
first, a hastily constructed palmetto-log
fort, was built in 1776 to protect
Charleston against British attack; the
second, a five-sided earth and timber
fort, was completed in 1798 as part of
the new Nation&rsquo;s first organized system
of coastal defense; and the third, a
more formidable masonry structure begun
after the second fort was destroyed
by a hurricane in 1804, has remained
structurally intact and modified only
by the replacement of old weapons
with new as technology changed.</p>
<p>During the Civil War, while the
struggle for Charleston Harbor centered
on Fort Sumter, Fort Moultrie
was far from idle and became &ldquo;a very
formidable enemy&rdquo; to Federal forces.
It powerful guns played an important
role in the Confederate bombardment
of Sumter in 1861. From April 1863 to
February 1865, Forts Moultrie and
Sumter were the chief defenders of
Charleston as repeated Federal land
and sea forces hammered at them.
&ldquo;From 1861 to 1865,&rdquo; one historian has
written, &ldquo;Fort Moultrie found itself engaged
in perhaps its strangest period of
coastal vigilance: defending the Confederate
States of America against the
United States of America.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fort today is part of Fort Sumter
National Monument and has been restored
to interpret the history of nearly
100 years of seacoast defense. From
the Harbor Entrance Control Post of
World War II the visitor moves steadily
backward in time to the exhibit recounting
the fateful attack of the British
fleet against the first Fort Moultrie
in 1776. The visitor center contains a
display of artifacts recovered during
the restoration. It also provides a film
and slide show which documents the
proud heritage of coastal fortifications
in the United States. The grave of Seminole
Chief Osceola, who died a prisoner
at Moultrie in 1838, is just outside
the sally port. Nearby is a monument
listing the Federal sailors who died
aboard the monitor <i>Patapsco</i>, when it
was sunk in Charleston Harbor on January
15, 1865.</p>
<p>Battery Jasper, built adjacent to Fort
Moultrie in 1898, is also a part of the
national monument. Named in honor
of Sergeant Jasper of Revolutionary
War fame, this strong seacoast defense
work mounted four powerful 10-inch
&ldquo;disappearing&rdquo; cannon and, though unimpressive
in appearance, was infinitely
stronger than early masonry
structures built to protect Charleston
Harbor before the Civil War.</p>
<p>Fort Moultrie is about 10 miles east
of Charleston on Sullivan&rsquo;s Island. Follow
US 17 north from the city, then
take US 17 (business) to Mount Pleasant
and turn right onto SC 703. From
there follow the signs to the park visitor
center across from the fort on Middle
Street.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<h4 id="c19"><b>James Island</b></h4>
<p>James Island contains the site of Fort
Johnson, from which the opening shot
of the Civil War was fired on April 12,
1861. All that remains of the fort are an
early 19th-century brick powder magazine,
a commemorative marker, and
traces of the Confederate earthworks
of 1863-65. To reach the site, follow
US 17 south from Charleston and, after
crossing the Ashley River, take the
Folly Island turnoff onto Folly Road
(SC 171). Proceed 4.7 miles, then turn
left onto Fort Johnson Road, which
dead ends at the South Carolina Wildlife
and Marine Resource Department.</p>

</div>
<h4 id="c20"><b>Castle Pinckney</b></h4>
<p>Castle Pinckney, one of the first masonry
casemated forts in the United
States, was built in 1810. The circular
structure, named for Charles Cotesworth
Pinckney, a South Carolina Revolutionary
War leader, was one of the
first Federal installations seized by
South Carolina militia on December
27, 1860. Though too far out of range
to take part in any of the fighting during
the Civil War years, the fort was
still a vital link in the Confederate defenses
of Charleston. After the war it
was maintained as a harbor light station
until 1929.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/i29a.jpg" alt="Castle Pinckney" width="600" height="590" />
</div>
<h4 id="c21"><b>The Battery</b></h4>
<p>The Battery, or White Point Gardens
as it is more formally known, has been
a public park since the 1830s and is
one of Charleston&rsquo;s most picturesque
and historic settings. Soon after the
outbreak of the Civil War, Confederate
engineers erected huge earthen fortifications
here which withstood the
shelling of the Union guns mounted on
Morris Island. The fortifications were
abandoned and the heaviest guns destroyed
when Charleston was evacuated
in February 1865. The Battery
today contains some of the most elegant
structures in the city.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
